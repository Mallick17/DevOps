## **What is a Web Page?**
A **web page** is a document that can be displayed in a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). It can include:
- **Text**: The main content of the page.
- **Style information**: Controls how the page looks (e.g., colors, fonts, layout).
- **Scripts**: Adds interactivity, like buttons that respond when clicked.
- **Media**: Images, videos, and audio.

Every web page has a unique address called a **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator). To view a web page, simply type its URL into your browser's address bar and press Enter.

## **What is a Website?**
A **website** is a collection of related **web pages** that share the same domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`). Websites are connected through **links**, which allow users to navigate from one page to another.

When you visit a website, the first page you usually see is called the **homepage**. This page often serves as the main entry point to the rest of the site.

## **What is a Web Server?**
A **web server** is a computer that stores and delivers the files for one or more **websites**. When you type a URL into your browser, the web server sends the requested web page files to your browser so you can view them.

**Important Note**: Don’t confuse **websites** with **web servers**. A web server can host multiple websites. For example, if someone says, "My website is not responding," it usually means the web server hosting the website is having issues, making the website unavailable.

## **What is a Search Engine?**
A **search engine** is a special type of website (like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo) that helps you find web pages from other websites. It works by indexing billions of web pages and allowing you to search for specific information.

**Common Confusion**: Many people mix up **search engines** and **browsers**. Here’s the difference:
- A **browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) is software that retrieves and displays web pages.
- A **search engine** is a website that helps you find web pages.

For example, when you open a browser, it might show a search engine's homepage (like Google) or a search bar. This is why the two are often confused.
